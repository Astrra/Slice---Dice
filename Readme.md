### Dependencies

- Chai
- Chai HTTP

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```
npm test
```

### Test Suite

The test suite includes the following tests:

1. User login and token generation.
2. Adding a new record to the dataset.
3. Deleting a record by index from the dataset.
4. Fetching summary statistics for salary over the entire dataset.
